# Least-Square-Regression
Classify the given dataset with the least squares regression problem.
1. Use following regularizations
(a) Lasso (L1)
(b) Ridge (L2)
(c) Elastic net ( Lasso and Ridge combined)
(d) No Regularization
2. For each regularizations, experiment with the hyperparameters(if any) and report the
accuracies in the reports q4 report.pdf
3. For each regularization, use the best set of hyper parameters (in terms of accuracy) to
classify given dataset
3
4. The output of each python file should be ”N” lines and each line should contain the
class label. Here N denotes the size of test file
5. The codes will be executed as pythonq4 x.py < train f ile >< test f ile >
6. You can use scikit-learn library to solve the regression problem.
